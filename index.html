                                    <p>I met Josh upon moving to Providence after spending five years living and going to school in Boston. I wasn’t entirely sure of my career path post college and figured I could bartend while being near my family. I had faith that eventually things would fall into place.</p>
 
<p>I picked up a bartending job in the city and my first day was Josh’s last day. I can still remember seeing him from across the outdoor patio and being instantly drawn to him. Naturally, I did what any other bold and modern girl would do: I found him on Facebook and poked him. That poke led to some messaging, an exchange of numbers and eventually a date. On our first date Josh took me to all the places he loved in Providence. We went to dive bars, cocktail bars and eventually out dancing. I met some of his good friends, we made some new friends and laughed a bunch along the way.</p>
 
<p>After a few more dates Josh and I came to the conclusion that although we both loved going out and the same The Academy Is songs, we just didn’t have much else in common. I should also mention that Josh and I are both very hard headed (working on it!) and back then we were young enough to believe we had life figured out. We butt heads and parted ways. To put it into perspective that was 6 years ago.</p>
 
<p>Wanderlust crept in and I moved back to Boston with my Matron of Honor where we stayed for two and a half years. In September 2012, Kait got a job in Manhattan and we devised a plan for me to meet her there in spring 2013. In the interim I moved back to Providence to save some money.</p>
 
<p>It seems that Josh still had my number after all those years and sent me a text one afternoon. Somehow he had discovered that I was temporarily back in Providence. We chatted for a few weeks but I kept things very vague when he would ask to go out. Always the practical one, I didn’t see any sense in investing time into a person I had already dated who lived in a state that I wasn’t staying in.</p>
 
<p>One Sunday afternoon I made plans to go to a festival with a girlfriend. I was walking out the door to meet her when she called me to cancel. Within the space of a few minutes Josh then invited me to go to that same festival with him. As it turned out, Josh and I hit it off the second time around. I mean really hit it off. It seems that we had both grown during that two year reprieve and now we fit together in a way that wasn’t possible before.</p>
 
<p>Eventually the deadline to move to New York came and went and I stayed in Providence with Josh. Although I loved being with Josh, I started feeling antsy about staying in Providence. Josh sensed my restlessness and for my 26th birthday he made me a video of our favorite Providence memories. At the end of the video there was a note that read “It doesn’t matter where we are (or aren’t) if I’m with you and you’re with me that’s home.” This was Josh’s consent to explore somewhere new.</p>
 
<p>Our conversations evolved from New York to Chicago and eventually settled on Nashville, where Josh could continue playing music. In March 2014, we packed up all of our stuff and began our journey to Nashville; each of us knowing that we had already found our permanent home. In October, Josh and I will be getting married on the date of our (second) first date.</p>

                                <div class="item">
                                    <h4 class="item-title text-center"><span class="icon-jar love-icon"></span>His Story</h4>
                                    <p>I saw Meg for the first time in August of 2009, a week or so after my 24th birthday.  We were in the kitchen of Pearl, the nightclub where I had worked on and off for a few years.  Meg admitted to me in a moment of weakness that she thought I was a celebrity DJ, something I hope to overcome at some point in my life.  I thought she was beautiful and I immediately regretted that I wasn't going to get the chance to work with her for more than three days, as I had just turned in my two weeks notice.  </p>

<p>Fortunately, Meg wasn't one to sit around and wait for fate to intervene.  A week after leaving she messaged me on Facebook and we decided to grab a drink.  Our first night out we went to the grand opening of the restaurant I was helping my roommate launch, did shots at Talk of The Town (a Providence dive bar), and went dancing at a nightclub.  It was foreshadowing to what our relationship would one day become, I love Meg because no matter what the setting is, she always has a great time, we never quite fit into any mold and I hope we never do.  </p>

<p>After a few dates, we parted way, to the best of my recollection younger Josh was a bit of a handful. Meg moved back to Boston, I went on with my life in Providence, occasionally trying to find my way, mostly just playing music waiting for something exciting to happen.  Every once and a while we'd like the other person's picture from a concert or pop into consciousness as a passing thought.   Late summer of 2012 brought about what would become a defining moment in our lives, both Meg and I newly single, back in the same state.  It took probably about a month of failed attempts, but on October 8th, 2012, sporting a mighty headache from one of my best friend's wedding's the night before (Seth), Meg agreed to meet up for a drink.  I saw her for the first time in years, waiting to drive us to Providence in the Showcase Cinemas parking lot.  She looked amazing, I started to realize just how lucky I was that the universe had nudged us back together.  </p>

<p>It took some serious convincing, as it should have, that I was a changed man.  There were some fairly open conversations about the lessons we had learned since we last hung out, the people we wanted to be, the people we didn't, and that there was something we definitely couldn't put a finger on that made us more alike than different.  I showed Meg the version of Providence I had grown to love, she showed me not every meal needed to come from a takeout container or be eaten at 5pm on the dot.  She came to see my band play, I learned about her love for fashion, about her friends in New York City.  We both had big ideas, big dreams, loving and loyal (occasionally complicated) families, and a desire for adventure.  We started as friends, had a really awkward attempt at a first kiss, version two, and eventually all the little gestures of kindness we showed each other took hold.  There was the bottle of Jameson she bought me as a housewarming gift, the couple costume we wore on our first halloween, the love for music we both shared, the trip to Block Island in the middle of a snow storm.  "Do you want to hang out" turned into "What are we doing this weekend", "I'm interested" became "I love you", we slowly built our foundation.  </p>

<p>A year and a half in, after six months of living in our first shared apartment in Providence, we realized it was time for a change.  New York, Austin, Dublin, and Chicago all were on our radar, but eventually with a lot of Meg's encouragement I took a job playing guitar for my old band in Nashville.  We packed up, said some tearful goodbyes, and headed south on our grand adventure.  To date, neither of us had lived more than a couple hours drive from home, so it was an adjustment.  A tiny apartment that our furniture didn't fit in, being homesick, being unsure, and downright scared all came as part of the deal.  But with that came a sense of hope, a new beginning, defining ourselves, our relationship, and all the excitement that came with living in a boomtown.  We were surrounded by amazing, likeminded people, all out to have adventures, create new things, and be inspired by the future.  In the midst of all the chaos, we found a home.  </p>

<p>To almost no one's surprise, and perhaps slightly overdue, spring of 2015 brought an engagement.  I managed to get a look of shock on Meg's face, by sneaking out on a Friday to buy her a ring, and popping the question in the park that Sunday, near the tiny apartment we had moved out of earlier that year.  I've never been so nervous, so sure, and so filled with joy all at the same time.  We spent three quiet hours on a farm, just west of the city, before calling our families to tell them the news.  Life has been generous with second chances, I plan on spending the rest of my days making up for the in between years apart.  Lucky for me, every year with Meg has more meaning than ten without her, I can't wait for October to marry her, I can barely wait for tomorrow just to be with her.      </p>
